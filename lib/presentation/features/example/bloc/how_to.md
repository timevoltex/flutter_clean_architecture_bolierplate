# Bloc Implementation Guide

This document explains how to implement Bloc in this project. Since we will be using extensions, you only need to create a Bloc or Cubit here.

1. Create a new Bloc or Cubit.
2. Implement the necessary logic and states.

That's it! You are ready to use Bloc in your project.
